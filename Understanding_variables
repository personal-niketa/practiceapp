Variables is a symbol or name that stands for a value.

Types of variables:

* Local Variables
  A local variable name must start with a lowercase letter (a-z) or underscore. It is only valid within fa block of code.

* Instance Variables
  These are shared across all methods for the same object. The instance variable name must start with '@' character.
  Note: An uninitialized instance variable has a value of nil.

* Class Variables 
  These are shared between a class, its subclasses and its instances. It must start with a '@@'.

* Global Variables
  It must start with '$'. Global variable are accessible everywhere.

* Constants
  A variable whose name begins with an uppercase letter (A-Z) is a constant. A constant can be reassigned a value after its initialization, but doing so will generate a warning. Every class is a constant.
